1. Start with requirements; analyse those requirements; formulate the needs and goals of the website - that is, what it must achieve.

2. After that stage you need to get it designed and made. Work from the outside in.

3. The visuals should be designed first, flat designs, getting the site looking exactly how it should be, everything on the interface that needs to be there, in the way you want it there.

4. Once the interface is totally designed, then the HTML/CSS structural build can begin. This gets the framework up, this should include all the variant pieces of the puzzle, the sections that are hidden, the components that come and go, move about, etc.

5. Finally the functionality can be put in, controlling all the parts with the necessary state control front and back to achieve the desired response from the interface.

6. Note that the backend code that the interface relies upon can usually be done at the same time as the structural build, as once the interface is fully designed, the backend requirements for provision to the interface can usually be established.

7. The intermediate layer of control code between the structural build and the backend code is the last thing at any rate, as it is the last coupling between the layers in terms of what must be finished before you can start (the critical path).
